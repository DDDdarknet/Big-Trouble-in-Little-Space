Project log ............ Star date year 2400 month ..........
We have continued our journey through perilous space, a couple crew members hurt but no worse for wear.
the Latest Davinci medical bot has saved us through a couple rough instances. Nobody has died, but I wonder what the goal of our journey is.
We have been flying through space at maximum speeds for over 5 years, but everything is slowly breaking down. I feel sorry for 91-One.
There are some early signs of wear but without them being operational I doubt our mission will be as successful.
The captain is calling for another planet scanning, guess itâ€™s time to get back to work.
You know between you and me I think this whole operation has been weirder ever since we made it past the last jump cannon.
Dark Space, while rarely ventured, what are we looking for? Why has the captain made us only stop at some plants and not all of the habitable planets?
Are we looking for materials or just a treasure?
Captain!? Yes Sir, ready for duty, on the double and no Sir, I apologize for my tardiness. Won't happen again Sir!
